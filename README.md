# WindSpeedData

My third assignment for week 5 for Fundamentals of Programming completed **13/12/2020**:

Using the sorted data you created in Question 1, identify the maximum and minimum wind speed values.  Create an array consisting of five “bins” that divide the extremes of the data range into five equally spaced partitions.  Create code that will read in the unsorted data, counting the frequency of instances of the data falling into each bin/partition. Print out the frequencies in an informative format.
